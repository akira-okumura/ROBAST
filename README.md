# ROBAST
Are you looking for ROOT-based simulator for ray tracing (ROBAST)?

This repository was cited in a few conference proceedings of the Cherenkov Telescope Array by mistake. You cannot get any ROBAST information here.

Please visit the ROBAST official website http://robast.github.io/ instead. You can find the master repository of ROBAST at https://github.com/ROBAST/ROBAST .

Please note that the old ROBAST website at https://sourceforge.net/projects/robast/ is obsolete.
